To build the executables of the generator, you need an Ada compiler.
On Debian or Ubuntu, get GNAT the standard way for getting software.
On Windows, you can get GNAT for free at https://www.adacore.com/community,
or obtain another compiler (ObjectAda, Janus, etc.) from their respective vendors.
Then, run "gprbuild -P delirium" (GNAT) or similar process.
The executable is produce_corporate_bullshit or produce_corporate_bullshit.exe (Windows)

A live version is available at: http://cbsg.sf.net .
