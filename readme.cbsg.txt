The Corporate Bullshit Generator 

The details about history, copyright, author, contributors can be found in the file corporate_bullshit.ads

To build the executables of the generator, you need an Ada compiler.
On Debian or Ubuntu, get GNAT the standard way for getting software.
On Windows, you can get GNAT for free at http://libre.adacore.com, or obtain another compiler (ObjectAda, Janus, etc.) from their respective vendors.
Then, run "gnatmake -P delirium" (GNAT) or similar process.
The executable is produce_corporate_bullshit or produce_corporate_bullshit.exe (Windows)

A live version is at http://cbsg.sf.net .

Enjoy!
